  "summary": "Humans demonstrated an aggregate accuracy of 60.3% in detecting AI-generated images, with class-conditional analysis revealing superior performance in identifying real images (67.8%) compared to AI-generated images (52.8%). This difference was primarily due to an authenticity bias, leading participants to more often label AI images as real rather than vice versa. A modest upward drift in human detection accuracy was also observed over the 55-week deployment period.",
