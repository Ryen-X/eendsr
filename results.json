  "title": "Based on the text provided, the title of the paper is:\n\n**TYCOV: An Open-Source, Year-Long Behavioral Study of Human Ability to Detect AI-Generated Images**",
  "authors": [],
  "summary": "Unaided human detection of AI-generated images is only modestly reliable, achieving an aggregate accuracy of 60.3%. This overall performance is asymmetric: participants identified real images with greater reliability (67.8% accuracy) than they did AI-generated ones (52.8% accuracy). This disparity reveals a significant authenticity bias, as observers are more likely to misclassify an AI image as real than the reverse, tending to err toward assuming an image is authentic.",
