  "summary": "Unaided human detection of AI-generated images proved modest and asymmetric, achieving an aggregate accuracy of 60.3%. Participants identified real images with significantly greater reliability (67.8% accuracy) than AI-generated images (52.8% accuracy), indicating an authenticity bias where AI-generated content is more often mislabeled as real than genuine images are misidentified as AI-generated. Despite this inherent asymmetry and modest overall performance, a modest upward drift in weekly mean accuracy was observed over a 55-week period.",
