# Research Findings: PRISMA Flow Diagram Generation

## Objective
To identify the most suitable Python library for programmatically generating a PRISMA 2020 flow diagram.

## Research Summary
We investigated three primary candidates for this task: `Matplotlib`, `Diagrams`, and `Graphviz` (via the `graphviz` Python wrapper).

### 1. Matplotlib
- **Pros:** Highly flexible, common scientific dependency.
- **Cons:** Requires complete manual calculation of all node and edge coordinates. The code would be complex, difficult to maintain, and not idiomatic for this task. **Decision: Rejected.**

### 2. Diagrams
- **Pros:** High-level syntax, uses Graphviz for rendering.
- **Cons:** Heavily domain-specific, focused on cloud architecture diagrams with icons. Adapting it for a PRISMA chart would be unconventional. **Decision: Rejected.**

### 3. Graphviz
- **Pros:**
    - Specifically designed for creating node-and-edge diagrams (graphs).
    - Automatically handles the complex layout of the diagram.
    - Highly customizable nodes, edges, colors, and text.
    - Mature, well-documented, and produces professional-quality output in multiple formats (PNG, SVG, etc.).
- **Cons:**
    - Requires an external system dependency (the Graphviz command-line tools) that users must install separately.

## Prototype
A prototype was created using the `graphviz` library. It successfully generated the basic structure of a PRISMA diagram with minimal code, confirming its suitability. The automatic layout (`rankdir='TB'`) and orthogonal line connectors (`splines='ortho'`) are ideal for this purpose.

## Final Decision
The `graphviz` library is the chosen tool for implementing the PRISMA flow diagram generation in Phase 26. The significant advantage of automatic layout far outweighs the minor inconvenience of an external dependency, which will be clearly documented for users.
